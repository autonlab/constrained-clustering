# ConstrainedClustering
Repository for comparison of constraint clustering algorithms

## Structure
In order to reproduce the experiment execute the norebook `Experiments.ipynb` and then `Visualizations.ipynb` which allows to analyze the results and compare the different methods.  
All the other functions contains functions used for the clustering. 

## Dependencies
This code has been executed with `python3` with the library indicated in `requirements.txt`. Additionaly, it is necessary to have R installed with the library `conclust`.

## Results
